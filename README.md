# Nuck's Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles.  They're designed for a dark background with white text, and they require 
full 256-color support in your Terminal.  They don't aim for flashiness or to be overly colorful; 
they aim to get the fuck out of your way.

# ZShell
There is no `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` because, quite simply, bash is boring.  I use zshell.

This is possibly the most interesting part of my dotfiles, and if you don't use any other parts of
them, I strongly recommend this at the very least.  I use a heavily-modified version of `oh-my-zsh`
which is specifically designed to be lightweight.  None of that "comes with everything" trash.

I call it "Zilsh."
